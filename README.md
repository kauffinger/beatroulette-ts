# What is BeatRoulette?

Beatroulette is an app designed to streamline a gameshow for music producers.
In alternating fashion, producers collaboratively work on multiple tracks.

# How can I use it?

Currently the only way to play is to take part in the official gameshow on twitch by [cr3sh](https://www.twitch.tv/cr3sh106).
You can contact either him or me privately if you wish to be able to host your own BeatRoulette gameshow.

# Who created this?

The idea for the gameshow is fully authored by [cr3sh](https://www.twitch.tv/cr3sh106). The code is mine.
